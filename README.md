# Hello World in Batch
Feel free to copy and share.

Batch language happens to be what CMD somewhat runs on. Some batch commands can be run through the CMD shell itself. This Hello World program is one of them. All you need to do is goto the search bar and type __cmd__ and Command Prompt should pop up.

## Internally run Hello World without creating a .bat file
Just type in cmd: `echo Hello World!`

## Externally run Hello World
Create a .bat file and edit the code and put:

`echo Hello World!`
